#### Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code editor used is Juputer notebook on python 3.*, an application with a twitter account  is needed to get access to the Tweepy API

#### Project Motivation
This Project involves extracting over 2500 tweets from the WeRateDogs twitter profile. All kinds of cute dogs are shown in the extracted tweets. The data is accessed for quality and tidyness issues.
The tweepy API was used to extract tweet data, there after the data was wrangled and explored for insights.
This project counts towards my udacity data analyst Nanodegree certification.

#### File Descriptions
All the data wrangling steps are documented in the wrangle_act.ipynb notebook. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

#### Results
The main findings are documented in the wrangle_report.html

#### Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements
Much credit to Udacity for suggesting this project, and Twitter for granting access to the Tweepy API. Feel free to use the code here as you would like!
